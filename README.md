# Cluster-utils
My utilities for ClusterCTRL for the RasPi

## Commands
All commands are a sub command of ```cluster```
so the ```logs``` command would be ```cluster logs```
Command Name | Description
------------ | -----------
log/logs | Runs ````tail -f /var/log/daemon.log /var/log/kern.log```` as detailed in https://8086.support/index.php?action=faq&cat=23&id=97&artlang=en
